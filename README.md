## TODOS

TODO doesn't work well with the "back" button of iOS safari - probably don't get the "unfocus" event

TODO build: no auto build; do manually the town (nx build town) , then site (nx build astroblog), then copy assets dir right into astroblog build root `cp -R packages/town/assets dist/packages/astroblog`; it's baked in

TODO until this https://github.com/Cammisuli/monodon/pull/22 is resolved, I check out my fork and use it as dependency or as an alternative symlink it into packages: `ln -s ~/work/blog/monodon/packages/rust`

TODO topLevelAwait() plugin just crashes build without no useful error indication

TODO https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/3800 - size optimisations
